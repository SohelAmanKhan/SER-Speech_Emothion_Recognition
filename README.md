SER-Speech Emotion Recognition
 
OBJECTIVE
Speech Emotion Recognition(SER) -
• It is a task
• Use Speech as input
• Process the speech(feature extraction , 
feature selection)
• Model the speech(using AI)
• recognizing the emotional

TECHNOLOGY USED
Computer-Lenovo ideapad 310
Software- Python 3.9
DataSet- Ravdess Dataset

FEATURE(MFCC)(Used by librosa Python library)
A subset of features that are used for speech emotion detection is grouped under 
a category called the Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) . It can be 
explained as follows:
• The word Mel represents the scale used in Frequency vs Pitch measurement . 
The value measured in frequency scale can be converted into Mel scale using 
the formula m = 2595 log10 (1 + (f/700))
• The word Cepstrum represents the Fourier Transform of the log spectrum of 
the speech signal.

Machine learning Algorithm(Used by sklearn Python library))-

Machine learning is-
• a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science
• focuses on the use of data and algorithms 
• It is imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving 
its accuracy.

ALGORITHM USED
•LOGISTIC REGRESSION
•NAIVE BAYES
•SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES
•K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR
•DECISION TREE
•RANDOM FOREST
•GRADIENT BOOSTING TREE

MAX ACCURACY
Linear_SVM - 78.9474
Polynomial_SVM - 18.4211
RBF_SVM - 15.7895

DEPLOYMENT
This project is deployed by tkinter python library

RESULT-
As per my study ,I find Gradient_Boosting(81.5789%)

Decision_Tree(81.5789%)

Random_Forest(81.5789%) as best Machine learning algorithm for this problem.
 My opinion is that this algorithms is suitable for this type of problem.

Thank you.
